# Sunfish Refactoring and Bug Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring and bug fixes applied to the Sunfish HMM-based gene prediction tool.

## Critical Bug Fixes Completed

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Sequence Bonuses in Viterbi Algorithm
**Location:** `src/hmm.c` (hmm_viterbi function, ~lines 1200-1262)

**Problem:** The Viterbi algorithm was ignoring the learned HMM parameters and using hardcoded sequence checks with `kHugeBonus` values (+100 log-probability) or `-INFINITY` penalties based on exact ATG/stop codon matches. This completely bypassed the probabilistic model.

**Fix:** Removed ~60 lines of hardcoded sequence checking logic. The algorithm now relies entirely on the learned transition probabilities from the HMM model.

**Impact:** Gene predictions now properly reflect the learned statistical model rather than rigid sequence rules.

### 2. Fixed GFF Parser Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
**Location:** `src/gff_parser.c` (line 55)

**Problem:** `sscanf` used `%[^\n]` format specifier without length limit when reading into a 50000-byte buffer, creating potential buffer overflow.

**Fix:** Changed to `%49999[^\n]` to enforce maximum field length.

**Impact:** Prevents potential security vulnerability and crashes on malformed GFF files.

### 3. Increased Maximum Intron Length Support
**Location:** `include/constants.h` (line 37), `src/hmm.c` (line 1041)

**Problem:** `PRACTICAL_MAX_DURATION` was hardcoded to 5000 bases, preventing detection of longer introns common in eukaryotic genes.

**Fix:** 
- Increased `MAX_DURATION` constant from 10000 to 50000 bases
- Changed `PRACTICAL_MAX_DURATION` to use `MAX_DURATION` instead of hardcoded 5000

**Impact:** Can now properly predict genes with introns up to 50kb in length (10x improvement).

### 4. Fixed GFF Phase Field Parsing
**Location:** `src/gff_parser.c` (lines 86-92)

**Problem:** Phase field parsing blindly computed `phase_char - '0'`, producing invalid values when phase was '.' (unspecified).

**Fix:** Added validation to check if phase_char is a digit (0-2), defaulting to 0 for '.' or other invalid values.

**Impact:** More robust handling of valid GFF3 files with unspecified phase fields.

### 5. Fixed Missing GMM Weight Initialization in Legacy Models
**Location:** `src/hmm.c` (line 1644)

**Problem:** When loading legacy single-Gaussian model files, the code initialized weights for components 1+ but not component 0.

**Fix:** Added explicit initialization of `model->emission[i].weight[0] = 1.0 / GMM_COMPONENTS` before the loop.

**Impact:** Legacy model files now load correctly with proper GMM component weights.

## Already-Correct Code (Verified)

### 1. ORF Validation
**Location:** `src/sunfish.c` (is_valid_orf function)

**Status:** The function is fully implemented and active, checking:
- Length is multiple of 3
- Starts with ATG
- No internal stop codons
- Ends with valid stop codon (TAA/TAG/TGA)

No fixes were needed.

### 2. Start/Stop Codon Inclusion in Predictions
**Location:** `src/sunfish.c` (predict_sequence_worker function)

**Status:** The code correctly includes STATE_START_CODON and STATE_STOP_CODON positions in exon boundaries. The logic at lines 1395-1398 extends the gene region for these states, and when closing exons, it includes them in the final coordinates.

No fixes were needed.

### 3. Exon Emission Probability Calculation
**Location:** `src/hmm.c` (hmm_viterbi function, lines 1137-1152)

**Status:** The code correctly:
- Tracks frame state using `hmm_exon_entry_index()` and `hmm_exon_next_index()`
- Calls `mixture_log_pdf()` with the appropriate frame state for each position
- Accumulates emission probabilities based on actual frame progression

No fixes were needed.

### 4. Memory Management (realloc usage)
**Location:** `src/fasta_parser.c`, `src/gff_parser.c`

**Status:** All realloc calls correctly use temporary variables and check for NULL before assigning to the original pointer, preventing memory leaks on allocation failure.

No fixes were needed.

## Deferred Items

### 1. K-means GMM Initialization for Supervised Training
**Reason for Deferral:** Implementing proper K-means clustering would require:
- Collecting all observations for each state before processing
- Implementing or integrating a K-means algorithm
- Restructuring the supervised training pipeline
- Extensive testing to ensure correctness

**Current Status:** The code uses soft responsibilities based on randomly initialized GMM parameters. While not optimal, this approach still allows the EM algorithm to refine the parameters during Baum-Welch training.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing in a future release with dedicated testing.

### 2. Global Variable Refactoring
**Reason for Deferral:** Moving all global configuration variables into a `SunfishConfig` structure would require:
- Creating the new structure type
- Updating ~50+ function signatures to accept the config parameter
- Threading the config through the entire call chain
- Risk of introducing bugs without comprehensive testing

**Current Status:** Global variables are clearly documented and work correctly in the single-instance use case.

**Recommendation:** Consider for future release when comprehensive test coverage is available.

### 3. Two-Pass Variance Calculation
**Reason for Deferral:** 
- Current one-pass algorithm uses `E[X²] - E[X]²` which can be numerically unstable
- However, the code has safeguards (kVarianceFloor = 1e-5)
- Changing to two-pass would require restructuring EM accumulation logic
- Online accumulation across sequences makes true two-pass complex

**Current Status:** Works adequately with numerical safeguards in place.

**Recommendation:** Monitor for numerical issues; implement if problems are observed.

### 4. Type Modernization (int to size_t)
**Reason for Deferral:**
- Would require changing fundamental types throughout the codebase
- Affects function signatures, loop variables, and data structures
- Risk of introducing subtle bugs (signed/unsigned comparison issues)
- Current int type is sufficient for genomic sequences < 2GB

**Current Status:** Code works correctly with current types.

**Recommendation:** Consider for major version update with extensive testing.
