# Implementation Summary: HMM-Based Gene Prediction with CWT Features

## Overview

This implementation transforms the Sunfish gene prediction tool into an advanced system using:
- Continuous Density Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for feature extraction
- Parallelization using POSIX threads (pthreads)

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Numerical Components (`src/fft.c`, `include/fft.h`)

**FFT Implementation (from scratch)**:
- Cooley-Tukey algorithm with bit-reversal permutation
- Forward and inverse FFT functions
- Power-of-2 utilities
- No external dependencies (no FFTW)

**Key Features**:
- Iterative in-place computation
- Proper normalization for IFFT
- Complex number support via C99 `<complex.h>`

### 2. Threading Infrastructure (`src/thread_pool.c`, `include/thread_pool.h`)

**Pthread Worker Pool**:
- Task queue with linked list structure
- Configurable number of worker threads
- Synchronization primitives:
  - Mutex for queue protection
  - Condition variables for task signaling
  - Wait functionality for completion

**Benefits**:
- Reusable threads (no creation/destruction overhead)
- Thread-safe task submission
- Efficient parallel processing

### 3. CWT Feature Extractor (`src/cwt.c`, `include/cwt.h`)

**DNA to Signal Conversion**:
- Maps bases to complex plane: A→(1+0i), C→(-1+0i), G→(0+1i), T→(0-1i)
- Configurable mapping function

**Morlet Wavelet Generation**:
- Formula: ψ(t) = (1/√(s·π^(1/4))) · exp(-1/2·(t/s)²) · exp(-j·2π·t/s)
- Multiple scale support
- Gaussian-modulated complex oscillation

**Frequency-Domain Convolution**:
- Pad signal and wavelet to power of 2
- FFT of both signals
- Element-wise multiplication in frequency domain
- IFFT to get convolution result
- Magnitude extraction and normalization

**Multi-Scale Features**:
- Computes CWT at multiple scales simultaneously
- Returns normalized feature matrix [num_scales × seq_len]

### 4. Continuous Emission HMM (`src/hmm.c`, `include/hmm.h`)

**HMM States**:
- 5 states: Exon_F0, Exon_F1, Exon_F2, Intron, Intergenic
- Frame-specific exon states for reading frame tracking

**Emission Model**:
- Multivariate Gaussian with diagonal covariance
- Mean vector and variance vector per state
- Efficient log-space PDF computation
- Extensible to GMM in future

**Model Structure**:
- Transition probability matrix [5×5]
- Initial state probabilities
- Emission parameters for each state
- Save/load functionality

### 5. Baum-Welch Training (`src/hmm.c`)

**Forward-Backward Algorithm (E-step)**:
- Computes α (forward probabilities)
- Computes β (backward probabilities)
- Calculates γ (state posteriors)
- Calculates ξ (transition posteriors)
- Log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability

**Parameter Re-estimation (M-step)**:
- Updates initial probabilities
- Updates transition matrix
- Updates Gaussian means (weighted average)
- Updates Gaussian variances
- Proper normalization

**Training Loop**:
- Iterates until convergence
- Monitors log-likelihood
- Threshold-based stopping (default: 0.01)
- Saves final model to disk

### 6. Parallel Viterbi Prediction (`src/sunfish_hmm.c`)

**Prediction Pipeline**:
1. Load trained HMM model
2. Create thread pool
3. For each sequence:
   - Submit task to pool
   - Compute CWT features
   - Run Viterbi algorithm
   - Decode state sequence
   - Extract gene regions
4. Wait for all tasks
5. Output results

**Viterbi Algorithm**:
- Dynamic programming for optimal state path
- Log-space computation
- Gaussian PDF for emission probabilities
- Backtracking for state sequence

**Thread Safety**:
- Mutex-protected output queue
- Atomic gene counter updates
- Independent task processing
- Ordered output collection

### 7. Utility Functions (`src/utils.c`)

**FASTA Parsing**:
- Robust multi-sequence support
- Dynamic memory management
- Handles large sequences

**GFF3 Parsing**:
- CDS feature extraction
- Parent-child relationships
- Exon grouping

## Testing
