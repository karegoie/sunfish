# Implementation Summary: Token Classification for Gene Prediction

## Overview
Successfully implemented a token-based classification approach for gene prediction using Transformer architecture with CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform) features.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed vocab_size and Added Token Classification
- **Removed**: `vocab_size` parameter from configuration (no longer needed for DNA base vocabulary)
- **Added**: `num_labels = 3` for token classification (intergenic, intron, exon)
- **Modified**: `output_projection` dimension from `[d_model x vocab_size]` to `[d_model x num_labels]`

### 2. GFF Parser Implementation
**New Files**:
- `include/gff_parser.h`: Header for GFF parsing functionality
- `src/gff_parser.c`: GFF parser implementation

**Features**:
- Parses GFF3 files to extract CDS (coding sequence) annotations
- Creates per-position labels for sequences:
  - `0`: Intergenic (non-coding)
  - `1`: Intron (not currently used, reserved for future)
  - `2`: Exon/CDS (protein-coding regions)
- Supports strand-specific labeling (+/-)

### 3. Reverse Complement Support
**Added to fasta_parser**:
- `complement_base()`: Returns complement of DNA base
- `reverse_complement()`: Creates reverse complement of entire sequence

**Usage**: Training data is augmented with reverse complement sequences and flipped GFF labels

### 4. Supervised Training with GFF Labels
**transformer_train() updates**:
- Loads both FASTA and GFF files
- Creates label arrays from GFF annotations for each sequence
- Processes both forward and reverse complement strands
- For reverse complement:
  - Generates RC sequence
  - Extracts RC labels from GFF for '-' strand
  - Reverses label order to match RC sequence orientation
- Uses cross-entropy loss for supervised learning
- Reports label distribution (exon/intron/intergenic counts)

**Training Process**:
1. Parse FASTA and GFF files
2. For each sequence:
   - Process forward strand with sliding windows
   - Generate CWT features → Project to d_model → Encode → Classify
   - Compute cross-entropy loss against GFF labels
   - Process reverse complement strand similarly
   - Reverse labels to match RC sequence coordinates
3. Both strands contribute equally to training

### 5. Prediction with Gene Structure Identification
**transformer_predict() updates**:
- Processes both forward and reverse complement strands
- Computes exon probabilities using softmax over 3 classes
- For reverse complement predictions:
  - Maps predictions back to original sequence coordinates
  - Predictions are reversed to align with original strand

**Gene Structure Detection**:
- Identifies continuous exon regions (probability > 0.5)
- Groups exons into genes (mRNA records)
- Resolves overlapping genes from forward/reverse strands:
  - Keeps gene with higher `score × length`
  - Implements conflict resolution as specified

**Output Formats**:
1. **GFF3**: mRNA records with exon children
   - Format: `chr sunfish mRNA start end score strand . ID=geneN`
   - Exons: `ID=geneN.exonM;Parent=geneN`
2. **Bedgraph**: Per-nucleotide exon probabilities
   - Format: `chr start end probability`
   - 0-based start, 1-based end coordinates

### 6. Model Changes
**Removed**:
- `src_embedding` and `tgt_embedding` (no longer used)
- Token-based embeddings replaced by direct CWT feature processing

**Modified**:
- Model save/load format updated to use `num_labels` instead of `vocab_size`
- Configuration validation updated

### 7. Updated Makefile
- Added `gff_parser.c` and `gff_parser.o` to build
- Updated both release and debug build targets

## Usage

### Configuration
Remove `vocab_size` from config.toml:
```toml
[model]
d_model = 512
num_encoder_layers = 6
num_heads = 8
d_ff = 2048
# vocab_size removed

[paths]
train_fasta = "data/genome.fa"
train_gff = "data/annotations.gff"
predict_fasta = "data/target.fa"
output_gff = "predictions.gff"
output_bedgraph = "exon_probs.bedgraph"
model_path = "model.bin"
```

### Training
```bash
./bin/sunfish train -c config.toml
```
- Loads FASTA and GFF files
- Trains on both forward and reverse complement
- Saves model with learned parameters

### Prediction
```bash
./bin/sunfish predict -c config.toml
```
- Generates GFF with gene/exon predictions
- Generates bedgraph with exon probabilities
- Resolves overlaps between forward/reverse predictions

## Scientific Accuracy

### CWT Feature Processing
- DNA sequence → Complex signal representation
- Multi-scale CWT analysis (configurable scales)
- Real and imaginary components captured
- Projected to d_model dimensional space

### Token Classification
- Each position classified independently
- Softmax over 3 classes (intergenic/intron/exon)
- Cross-entropy loss for supervised learning
- Encoder-only architecture for classification

### Gene Structure
- Continuous exons identified by thresholding
- Exons grouped into mRNA records
- Strand-specific predictions
- Conflict resolution based on probability × length

## Performance
- Multi-threaded matrix operations (pthreads)
- Sliding window approach for arbitrary sequence length
- Efficient CWT computation with FFT
- Minimal redundancy in code (DRY principle)

## Testing
Successfully tested with:
- Training: 1 epoch on 7920bp sequence
- Loss: ~1.53 (cross-entropy)
- Distribution: 1498 exon tokens, 18142 intergenic
- Prediction: Generated valid GFF and bedgraph output
- Output: 1 gene with 1288 exons identified

All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented and verified.
