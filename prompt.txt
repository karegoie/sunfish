# 반드시 지켜야 할 사항:
Code Quality and Optimization
Minimize Redundancy (DRY): Adhere strictly to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle. Abstract and reuse code wherever possible to maintain a compact and modular codebase.

Scientific Accuracy: Ensure your Transformer implementation is mathematically and algorithmically correct according to the original paper.

Performance Optimization: The code must be highly optimized. The use of pthreads is a minimum requirement. Analyze and optimize matrix operations and memory access patterns.
